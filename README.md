# justWatchWatcher
Checks the JustWatch website and emails me when a movie or TV show on my watch list is available to stream for free on one of the services I use.

Used in conjuction with something like Task Scheduler, can periodically check if a movie on your watchlist has recently become available 

For example: I didn't see 'Joker' when it was released in 2019 so I want to be alerted when it can be streamed for free.

Happy watching!
